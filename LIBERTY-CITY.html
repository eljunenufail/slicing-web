       <p class="text-gray-600">The New Tropic is an experience-based media and events company operating in Miami, USA. Their main focus is providing local news, unique stories, and creative events specifically designed for Miami residents who want to connect with and explore their city.</p>

       <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4 text-black"> Expansion & Replication Efforts: Does The New Tropic Exist in Other Cities?</h3>
       <p class="text-gray-600"> Although The New Tropic itself is based in Miami, its parent company, WhereBy.Us, has attempted to replicate the local-newsletter + community model in other cities. For example, in 2016 they launched a project called The Evergrey a media outlet for the city of Seattle, Washington.

           This means: The New Tropic does not directly "rebrand itself" for other cities. Instead, the model (its strategy, approach, and philosophy) developed by WhereBy.Us is used as a template for creating new local media brands in other cities.

            In this context, The Evergrey is a "sibling" of The New Tropic  not a Seattle edition of The New Tropic, but an entirely new brand under the same umbrella, attempting to bring a similar local and community focused approach to a different city (Seattle).</p>

The history of Miami would not be complete without Liberty City. This neighborhood appeared later than others, as if the city had forgotten about it and then remembered at the last moment. Its streets hold memories of hopes, protests, and films that made the world talk about it again. Liberty City began as a symbol of progress and pride, but became a mirror of the social contrasts that Miami is still trying to understand.

        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold">The birth of the neighborhood</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
     Until 1937, Liberty City was almost an empty space. The land belonged to white owners, and no one thought that one of the most important centers of African American culture would appear here. Everything changed in the early 1930s, when the overpopulated Overtown became synonymous with poverty. People lived without sewage or electricity, and local doctors sounded the alarm: in such conditions, disease spread faster than news.

It was then that lawyer John Gramling proposed creating a "new colony for blacks" outside the city. His motives were far from humanitarian; he simply feared that disease would reach the homes of white residents. But at that very moment, another voice emerged: Reverend John Calmer, a community leader and a man who believed that the new settlement could become a symbol of dignity.

Thanks to his campaigns and pressure from the press, federal funds were allocated to the construction of the Liberty Square Housing Project, the first public housing complex for African Americans in the southern United States.

        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold">The emergence of Liberty Square</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
 Construction began in 1934, and in 1937, a residential neighborhood with 753 apartments opened. It quickly became home to hard-working families who dreamed of a better life. Liberty Square looked like a dream city with neat houses, clean streets, schools, and churches.

But even here, traces of segregation were visible. City planners erected a "race wall" along NW 12th Avenue to separate black residents from their few white neighbors. Part of this wall still stands today as a reminder of a time when the word "liberty" sounded ironic.

Over time, a neighborhood known as Liberty City grew up around the complex. Its boundaries are roughly between 42nd and 79th Streets, from I-95 to 27th Avenue. Schools, churches, businesses, and a sense of a strong, independent community were forming in Miami.

        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold">Rise and Fall</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          In the 1940s, Liberty City was booming. People worked, built houses, and raised children. But twenty years later, everything changed. Sociologist Marvin Dunn, himself a native of the neighborhood, said that three forces destroyed Liberty City: integration, drugs, and concrete.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Integration opened doors to previously inaccessible areas. Educated and affluent families moved away, taking with them resources and examples of success.</li>
            <li>The crack epidemic of the 1980s brought crime and despair.</li>
            <li>Concrete "monsters" were cheap high-rises built by investors who did not live in the area and did not invest in it. The buildings quickly fell into disrepair, becoming symbols of desolation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
           The neighborhood lost its sense of community and, with it, its confidence in the future.

        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold">The riots of 1979</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
On December 17, 1979, an incident occurred that changed Miami forever. Arthur McDuffie, a black insurance agent, was beaten by police after a chase and died a few days later. Five months later, the court acquitted the four defendants.

The news was the spark that ignited Liberty City. Dozens of people died in three days, hundreds of businesses were destroyed, and the damage exceeded $100 million. "They burned a neighborhood that wasn't theirs, that they never owned," said Marvin Dunn. After that, the neighborhood took a long time to recover, but it never really recovered.        </p>

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold">After Moonlight</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
The Oscar-winning film Moonlight reminded America of Liberty City once again. On screen, the neighborhood appeared to be a place where real people grew up. But, as T. Willard Farr, president of the Urban League of Greater Miami, noted, movies are not a panacea.

"Real change will begin when children see that successful families live alongside poor ones," he says. Fair is convinced that the path to the neighborhood's revival begins with education. Without strong schools, without the value of knowledge and common goals, Liberty City will remain a hostage to the past.

Today, the neighborhood continues to search for a balance between the past and the future. New projects, such as the redevelopment of Liberty Square, hold promise for positive change. However, most importantly, the residents still take pride in their community. Musicians, athletes, and filmmakers were born here, and each of them contributes their own note to the melody of Liberty City.

The neighborhood, which began as an experiment, has become a symbol of perseverance. And if there is a place in Miami where the word "liberty" still resonates with faith, it is here.        </p>
